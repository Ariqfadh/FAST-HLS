# Low-Power Hardware Accelerator for FAST Keypoint Detection in ORB Feature Extraction

## Overview
This research focuses on developing a low-power hardware accelerator for FAST keypoint detection in ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature extraction using FPGA. The implementation leverages **Vitis HLS** for high-level synthesis and integrates the generated IP with **Vivado IPI** for system-level design.

## Objectives
- Implement FAST keypoint detection as a hardware accelerator using FPGA.
- Optimize for low power consumption while maintaining real-time performance.
- Utilize **Vitis HLS** for high-level synthesis.
- Integrate the accelerator into **Vivado IPI** for seamless FPGA deployment.

## Methodology
1. **Algorithm Design**:
   - Analyze the FAST keypoint detection algorithm.
   - Identify computationally intensive operations suitable for hardware acceleration.

2. **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)**:
   - Implement FAST keypoint detection in **C/C++** using **Vitis HLS**.
   - Apply optimizations such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and dataflow techniques to enhance performance.
   - Generate an HLS-based IP core.

3. **Integration with Vivado IPI**:
   - Import the generated IP into **Vivado**.
   - Connect the IP with other system components (AXI interfaces, memory controllers, etc.).
   - Verify functionality through simulation and hardware testing.

4. **Power and Performance Evaluation**:
   - Measure power consumption using FPGA power analysis tools.
   - Compare execution time with software-based implementations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **FPGA Platform**: (Specify the FPGA board used, e.g., Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+)
- **Vitis HLS**: High-Level Synthesis tool for C/C++ to HDL conversion.
- **Vivado IPI**: Integrated design and implementation tool for FPGA development.
- **Python/OpenCV**: For validating FAST keypoint detection results.

## Results and Expected Impact
- Achieve real-time FAST keypoint detection with significantly reduced power consumption.
- Provide an efficient FPGA-based solution for feature extraction in embedded vision applications.
- Enable deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile and edge AI applications.

## Future Work
